# Paw Platoon - Pet Care Application

## The Proplem

As a military member I have noticed that Apps like Rover and Care do not cater to the military community, especially those of us who live on-base where a valid DoD ID is required to enter.
Military members are often on 12hr shifts, taking extended vacations to visit home, or are being deployed for months at a time and we need an app to connect us with pet care providers in the area who have access to our base. This is the goal of Paw Platoon.

## The Concept

Sign up as a Pet Care Provider or a User and connect to a base using the GoogleMaps API. 

User - will be able to browse the Pet Care Providers connected to their base and connect with one that they like. After the connection the User will be able to see summaries of each walk between the Pet Care Provider and their pets.

Pet Care Provider - will be able to accept connections from Users, view the User's pets and start/track their walks with that User's pets. They will also be able to see the weather for their walk that day.

## The APIs

Google Maps API for viewing/connecting to local bases

Open Weather API for Pet Care Providers to view the weather for their walks that day.
